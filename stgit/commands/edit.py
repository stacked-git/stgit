help = 'Edit a patch description or diff'
kind = 'patch'
usage = ['[options] [--] [<patch>]']
description = """
Edit the description and author information of the given patch (or the
current patch if no patch name was given). With --diff, also edit the
diff.

The editor is invoked with the following contents:

  From: A U Thor <author@example.com>
  Date: creation date

  Patch description

If --diff was specified, the diff appears at the bottom, after a
separator:

  ---

  Diff text

Command-line options can be used to modify specific information
without invoking the editor. (With the --edit option, the editor is
invoked even if such command-line options are given.)

If the patch diff is edited but does not apply, no changes are made to
the patch at all. The edited patch is saved to a file which you can
feed to "stg edit --file", once you have made sure it does apply.

With --set-tree you set the git tree of the patch to the specified
TREE-ISH without changing the tree of any other patches. When used on
the top patch, the index and work tree will be updated to match the
tree.  This low-level option is primarily meant to be used by tools
built on top of StGit, such as the Emacs mode. See also the --set-tree
flag of stg push."""
