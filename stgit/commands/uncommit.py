description = """
Take one or more git commits at the base of the current stack and turn
them into StGIT patches. The new patches are created as applied patches
at the bottom of the stack. This is the opposite of 'stg commit'.

By default, the number of patches to uncommit is determined by the
number of patch names provided on the command line. First name is used
for the first patch to uncommit, i.e. for the newest patch.

The -n/--number option specifies the number of patches to uncommit. In
this case, at most one patch name may be specified. It is used as
prefix to which the patch number is appended. If no patch names are
provided on the command line, StGIT automatically generates them based
on the first line of the patch description.

The -t/--to option specifies that all commits up to and including the
given commit should be uncommitted.

Only commits with exactly one parent can be uncommitted; in other
words, you can't uncommit a merge."""
